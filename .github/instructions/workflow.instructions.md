# Issue-First Development Workflow

Every product change must trace to a GitHub issue and land through a feature branch and PR.

## Default Workflow

1. Verify or create the GitHub issue.
2. Scan for an existing worktree for the issue; resume it if found.
3. Otherwise create a worktree from the default branch.
4. Implement scoped changes on a feature branch.
5. Commit as `type(scope): description (#N)`.
6. Run the repo's documented format, lint, type-check, test, and build commands for the affected surface.
7. Fetch and rebase onto the default branch.
8. Push the feature branch and create a PR with `Closes #N`.
9. Verify the PR exists with `gh pr view`.
10. Monitor CI and mergeability until checks are green and the PR is `MERGEABLE`.
11. Self-merge only PRs you authored when the quality gate passes and `AGENTS.md` permits it.
12. Remove the worktree after merge.

Stopping at a local commit is incomplete. A task is done only when the PR is merged, or when a green, mergeable PR clearly documents a `## Needs Human Action` blocker.

## Definition of Done

| Gate | Verification | Pass criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean tree | `git status` | No uncommitted changes. |
| Pushed | `git log origin/<branch>..HEAD` | Empty. |
| PR exists | `gh pr view <branch> --json number` | Returns a PR number. |
| CI green | `gh pr checks <number>` | No failing or pending required checks. |
| Mergeable | `gh pr view <number> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` | `MERGEABLE`, not dirty/behind. |
| Issue linked | PR body | `Closes #N` for each resolved issue. |
| Landed | `gh pr view <number> --json state` | `MERGED`, or a documented human-gated blocker. |

## Worktrees

Use git worktrees rather than extra clones.

```bash
git worktree list
git worktree add ../wt-<agent>-<type>-<issue> -b <type>/<short-description>-<issue> origin/<default-branch>
git worktree remove ../wt-<agent>-<type>-<issue>
```

Branch types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`.

## Issue Lifecycle

`Created → PR opened with Closes #N → PR merged → issue auto-closed`.

Rules:

- Do not close issues manually; let linked PRs close them on merge.
- Use `Closes #N` for completed work and `Refs #N` for related context.
- Put each closing reference on its own line in the PR body.

## Validation

Run the product's own commands. Prefer documented scripts over ad hoc tool calls.

Typical coverage:

- Formatter / format check.
- Linter.
- Type-check or static analysis.
- Unit/integration tests for changed behavior.
- Build/package checks for affected apps or packages.

If any check fails, fix it, rerun the relevant checks, amend or commit, and push again.

## Merge Conflict Protocol

Treat conflicts with the same urgency as red CI.

Detect every polling cycle:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,headRefName
```

| State | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `MERGEABLE` + `CLEAN`/`UNSTABLE` | Continue monitoring CI. |
| `MERGEABLE` + `BEHIND` | Rebase on the default branch and re-push. |
| `CONFLICTING` or `DIRTY` | Run the auto-resolve cycle. |
| `UNKNOWN` | Wait briefly and re-poll. |

Auto-resolve only mechanical conflicts you understand: whitespace, import order, regenerated files, changelog ordering, or lockfiles recreated by the repo's package manager. Escalate semantic conflicts such as same-function edits, schema changes, security-sensitive logic, or incompatible refactors.

Use `git push --force-with-lease` only after a rebase on your own PR branch. Never use plain `git push --force`.

## Fleet Coordination

For parallel sprint work:

1. Query issues and PRs.
2. Assign unclaimed issues by labels and file ownership in `AGENTS.md` / `agents/`.
3. Track assignments in SQL todos.
4. Batch small related issues only when they touch the same files and keep the PR under reviewable size.
5. Publish a merge order for dependent PRs.
6. Re-dispatch failed or incomplete agents until every PR is green and mergeable.
