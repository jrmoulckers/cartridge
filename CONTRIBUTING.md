# Contributing to JRM Studio



Thank you for contributing to a JRM Studio project! These shared guidelines apply across JRM Studio repositories and are inherited by product repos as default community-health files.



> **AI tools are not required to contribute.** GitHub Copilot and studio agents can help, but every contribution ? from typo fixes to new features ? is welcome with any editor and workflow you prefer.



## Code of Conduct



All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before participating.



## Quick Contributions



For small changes like fixing a typo, improving docs, or correcting a comment:



1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a branch for your change.

3. Make the smallest clear edit that solves the issue.

4. Open a pull request with a concise summary and testing notes.



Documentation-only changes usually do not need a full local build. If you are looking for a place to start, check issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.



## Issue-First Workflow



JRM Studio uses an issue-first, PR-always workflow:



1. Find or create a GitHub issue before starting work.

2. Work on a feature branch; do not commit directly to the default branch.

3. Use Conventional Commit messages with an issue reference: `type(scope): description (#N)`.

4. Push your branch and open a pull request against the default branch.

5. Include `Closes #N` in the PR body.

6. Run the repository's lint, format, test, type-check, and build commands as applicable.

7. Keep the PR focused, reviewable, and free of merge conflicts.



A change left only on a local branch is not complete.



## Getting Started



Each product repository defines its own stack, setup commands, and validation scripts. In general:



```bash

git clone https://github.com/jrmoulckers/<repository>.git

cd <repository>

git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>

```



Then read the repository's `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and any local setup documentation for product-specific requirements.



## Commit Messages



Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):



```text

type(scope): description (#N)

```



Supported types:



- `feat` ? new user-facing capability

- `fix` ? bug fix

- `docs` ? documentation-only change

- `style` ? formatting or style-only change

- `refactor` ? code change without behavior change

- `test` ? tests or test infrastructure

- `chore` ? maintenance

- `ci` ? CI/CD changes

- `perf` ? performance improvement



When AI agents create commits, include:



```text

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>

```



## Before Opening a PR



Run the checks documented by the repository you are changing. Typical gates include:



- Formatting and linting

- Type-checking or static analysis, where available

- Affected unit and integration tests

- Build or package validation, where available

- Documentation updates for changed behavior



If a check cannot be run locally, note why in the PR.



## Security, Privacy, and Accessibility



- Never commit secrets, credentials, access tokens, private keys, or real production data.

- Use placeholders in tracked examples and keep real values in git-ignored local files.

- Avoid logging sensitive data.

- Validate and sanitize external input.

- Follow the repository's accessibility expectations for user-facing changes.

- Document important design or architecture decisions in the repository's ADR location when applicable.



## Pull Requests



A good PR includes:



- A linked issue (`Closes #N`)

- A short summary of what changed and why

- Testing or validation performed

- Screenshots or recordings for UI changes, when useful

- Documentation updates, when behavior or setup changes

- Confirmation that no secrets or product-private data were added



## Need Help?



Use GitHub Discussions for questions and proposals, or open a focused issue when there is a clear task, bug, or feature request.
